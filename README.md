#Intertextuality in the Doctrine and Covenants
This project uses text analysis to identify places where the LDS Doctrine and Covenants (D&C) relies on the Hebrew Bible (HB).

The project analyzes both texts for common trigrams (prior to removing stopwords) then compares those trigrams to a corpus in order to assess their relative importance. The corpus needs to be relevant for religious texts and their unique use of the HB compared to fiction and non-fiction. This may make identifying a useful corpus challenging.

A pilot version of the code will explore the role of Genesis in the D&C by generating lists of trigrams, then I'll broaden the data to generate list of trigrams common to both the D&C and the HB.

Task List (Pilot Code)
1. Complete and debug code for identifying trigrams
2. Identify a relevant corpus for comparing trigrams.
3. Identify appropriate statistical methods for comparing frequencies of trigrams in texts.
4. Code methods in 3 and debug.
